.Sh NAME
.Nm gzeof
.Nd check end-of-file indicator
.
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libz
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zlib.h
.Ft int
.Fn gzeof "gzFile file"
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Returns true (1)
if the end-of-file indicator
has been set while reading,
false (0) otherwise.
Note that the end-of-file indicator
is set only if the read
tried to go past the end of the input,
but came up short.
Therefore,
just like
.Xr feof 3 ,
.Fn gzeof
may return false
even if there is no more data to read,
in the event that the last read request
was for the exact number of bytes
remaining in the input file.
This will happen if the input file size
is an exact multiple of the buffer size.
.
.Pp
If
.Fn gzeof
returns true,
then the read functions
will return no more data,
unless the end-of-file indicator
is reset by
.Xr gzclearerr 3
and the input file
has grown since the previous
end of file was detected.
