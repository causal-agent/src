the intersection or interior corner
of old brick factory buildings.
we're sort of looking at a vertical W shape,
with two buildings on either side
at a right angle,
and one corner peice of building
jutting out between the other two.
the old factory windows
of these buildings
are in various states of boarded up
or filled in with concrete
or left as-is.
there are pipes and ducts and conduits
crawling all over the buildings.
the right side wall
of the middle building piece
is covered in leafy vines.
the middle section
is shorter than the others
and light is coming over top of it
hitting the leftmost building.
