the brick wall of an old factory building
with sets of 6x4 pane windows,
where it looks like the middle 4x2
panes swivel open.
a round duct or chimney
has been installed
in one of the lower windows
and goes up the outside of the building.
two of the other windows
have been filled in,
one with brick
and one with metal.
they both have vents embedded in them.
an array of pipes climbs halfway up
the far right edge of this wall.
