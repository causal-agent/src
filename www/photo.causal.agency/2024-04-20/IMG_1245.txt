a tall shot of the back of a beautifully coloured building.
the brick wall has been painted a sort of pink,
or at least it's faded to that colour.
there is a splotch in the middle
where the paint has worn off the brick,
along with some stray bricks
elsewhere that have been replaced.
the spiral stairs descending
from the back balconies of two floors
have also been painted red,
but have faded to pink
closer to the top.
everything is a little crooked.
the old wooden-framed windows
on the left,
the more recently replaced doors,
and the balconies.
