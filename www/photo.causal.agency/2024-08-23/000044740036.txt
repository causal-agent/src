the back of a very strange
residential building
that's clearly been built onto.
on the right is a regular red wooden door.
on the left is a painted brown metal door
with a circular window in it
like a porthole.
this is at the bottom of a metal column,
presumably containing stairs,
with one more porthole
not far above the door.
slid right between this weird extension
and the side of the adjacent building
is a very tall ladder.
