the top cube of a brutalist house,
with one small window
in each the centre of each face.
the left face of the cube
has an overhang above
which continues down the side.
the concrete has large curved grooves
scattered over its surface.
the sun is hitting the left face,
shadowed by the overhang.
behind the cube is a blue sky
with scattered clouds.
