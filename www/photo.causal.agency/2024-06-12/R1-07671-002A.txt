the bottom of a spiral fire escape
black metal stair.
there's a piece of stone or concrete
at the bottom
with green moss growing on its edges.
the surrounding ground
is covered in dead leaves and such.
there's a peculiar orange-ish
mark that runs down
the middle right side of the frame
and wanders back and forth a little.
don't know what's up with that
and this is the only shot
on the roll with it.
