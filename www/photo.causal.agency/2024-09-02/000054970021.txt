fancy windows on the side of a school building.
it's a repeating pattern of three windows
in the middle of a house-shaped design
of yellow panels on the second floor.
the middle windows are higher than the other two.
the triangle at the top of the window design
is followed by the profile of the roof.
below that, separated by a row of even short windows,
are red panels.
the upper windows are reflecting blue sky and clouds,
while the lower red panels are reflecting trees and clouds.
