the side of a weird old
presumably european
tiny car that's been rotting
in an alley for who knows how long.
the car is painted black
and there's a bunch of graffiti in white
on the door and back side
as well as the window.
on the door next to the handle
there's a stenciled "GREMA".
behind the car is a wooden fence
with some deep green vines.
