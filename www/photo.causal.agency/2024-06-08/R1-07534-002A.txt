profile of Ayla on the couch in our apartment.
behind her on the left of the frame is a warm brick wall.
there's a band from what might be a light leak
just to the right of her head.
I've DIY replaced the light seals
on this camera so we'll see how it looks
on the next roll.
there's also a narrow dark band
at the right edge of the frame.
I don't know what's up with that.
