a selfie in a convex mirror
mounted on a telephone pole.
I appear quite small in the mirror.
I'm standing in front
of a building with
colourful graffiti on it.
behind the mirror
is a yellow diamond road sign,
and on the side of the pole
is a no trash sign
with a fine of up to $1000.
behind is a blue cloudy sky.
