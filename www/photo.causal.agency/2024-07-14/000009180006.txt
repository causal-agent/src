a weird plant with
like long stalks of I guess seeds
with little crowns of white flowers on the ends.
the depth of field is really shallow
so they come in and out of focus
from the blurred green background.
in the centre there's a bee
on one of the flowered ends
but it's too close to the camera
it's not in focus.
