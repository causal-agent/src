Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
software communities since 1998.[K

By connecting to freenode you indicate that you have read and
accept our policies and guidelines as set out on https://freenode.net

[H
[12M[10BIn the event that you observe behaviour that contravenes our policies,
please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further
information or, as appropriate, involve other parties such as channel operators

Group Contacts representing an on-topic group.

freenode runs an open proxy scanner.

If you are looking for assistance, you may be able to find a list of
volunteer staff on '/stats p' (shows only on-call staff) or by joining
[H
[12M[10B#freenode and using the '/who freenode/staff/*' command. You may message
any of us at any time. Please note that freenode predominantly provides
assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the
primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member
of the volunteer staff team.

From time to time, volunteer staff may send server-wide notices relating to
the project, or the communities that we host. The majority of such notices
will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project,
including
notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
