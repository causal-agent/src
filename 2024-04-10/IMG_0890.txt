a pipe coming out of a light brown brick wall.
the pipe comes out of a metal square in the centre of the wall,
travels up and left for a bit,
before continuing straight up out of frame.
opposite, in the bottom right,
is the top of a red metal grate in front
of a ground-level window.
the brick below where the pipe enters the wall
is stained dark.
