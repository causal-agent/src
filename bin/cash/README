NAME
     cash – the Causal Agency shell

DESCRIPTION
     cash is a shell derived from FreeBSD sh(1), which is in turn derived from
     Almquist shell.  It includes editline(3) from NetBSD.

   Differences from sh(1)
     •   ENV defaults to ‘${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/cash/env.sh’.

     •   PS0 is printed before each prompt, allowing multi-line prompts.

     •   Right-aligned prompts can be set with RPS1 and RPS2.

     •   PSlit can be used to embed terminal escape sequences in prompts, as
         in NetBSD sh(1).

     •   HOME is shortened to ‘~’ in prompt expansion.

     •   fc -s =new allows prefixing commands with new.

HISTORY
     sh(1) sources were imported from FreeBSD 12.0.  editline(3) sources were
     imported from NetBSD 8.0.
