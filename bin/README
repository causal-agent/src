                           pbd/pbcopy/pbpaste

TCP server which pipes into macOS pbcopy(1) and from pbpaste(1), and
pbcopy and pbpaste implementations that connect to it. Used to share
the macOS pasteboard over SSH with RemoteForward 7062 127.0.0.1:7062.
This used to make nvim's "+ register work but they seem to have changed
their detection.

                                  pngo

PNG optimizer. Does not support interlaced PNGs.

 - Discards ancillary chunks
 - Discards unnecessary alpha channel
 - Converts unnecessary truecolor to grayscale
 - Indexes color if possible
 - Reduces bit depth if possible
 - Applies a simple filter type heuristic
 - Applies zlib's best compression
