you gotta get yourself a cheap plair--
you gotta get yourself a cheap pair of plastic sunglasses
or a really cheap pair of plastic wraparounds
you can get em just down the street
it's four bucks for the pair
you should stock up
you should buy three or four pairs
really, no one ever fucks with you
you put em on
and no one fucks with you
and they're cheap
it's better than--
better than a wig
or a really stupid haircut
or a nose ring

you get afraid on the bus?
when you ever get--
you ever get scared on the bus?
or the subway?
you ever get afraid, and--

we were all really high
and I was sitting on the couch
we were all sitting on the couch
we were all really high
the TV was and it was dark and no one was saying a word
and no one had said a word for a long, long time
everyone was just staring at the TV set
and I got the fear
I got the fear really bad
I remember thinking, this is it, I'm going to die
