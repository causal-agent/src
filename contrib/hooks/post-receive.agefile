# An example hook to update the "agefile" for CGit's idle time calculation.
#
# This hook assumes that you are using the default agefile location of
# "info/web/last-modified".  If you change the value in your cgitrc then you
# must also change it here.
#
# To install the hook, copy (or link) it to the file "hooks/post-receive" in
# each of your repositories.

agefile="$(git rev-parse --git-dir)"/info/web/last-modified

	--sort=-authordate --count=1 \
	--format='%(authordate:iso8601)' \
